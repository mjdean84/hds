                    HDS started as a remodeling effort by Emily and her husband Joe back in May 2007. They were
                    contracted to do work for some family and friends that wanted to upgrade their existing homes
                    (bathrooms and kitchens are their specialty). This included providing design work, and upgrades to
                    kitchens and baths. Emily and Joe quickly determined that there was a tremendous need for this service
                    in the greater Phoenix/Scottsdale, AZ area. They applied for a business license and opened Home
                    Design Solutions as an LLC out of a small store location they rented at 101 Sedalia Drive, Phoenix, AZ
                    85001. The first store location included some sample cabinets and appliances that they would later
                    become regional distributors for. Both Joe and Emily became General Contractors in 2007 and all of
                    their bath and kitchen design specialists that have been hired since have acquired kitchen and bath
                    design certifications.

                    They saw rapid growth for their company and hired 2 sales associates to help with the increased demand
                    and 3 cabinet, appliance and bathroom installers and offer delivery services if needed. They added 2
                    more employees one to keep track of appointments and to schedule the work of the installers and
                    renovators. The other employee helped with deliveries and warehousing (they have a very limited
                    warehouse and cannot stock items for more than 2-3 weeks). They became so busy with their
                    construction, design and consultation services and trying to run a successful small business that they
                    hired a design/sales professional to take over much of their design work. In 2009 they opened a second
                    location at 901 S. Sedona Way, Scottsdale, AZ. This was a much smaller location and included only 4
                    employees (2 sales and design associates and 2 installation/renovation and delivery associates).

                <p>
                    Since that time the Scottsdale location has added 2 more installation/renovation and delivery associates, 1
                    office manager and 1 store manager that could also do sales and design work. This all took place
                    between 2009 and 2011. In 2012 they opened their third location in Tucson, AZ. This store was in a
                    strip mall at 8023 Sedalia Dr., Phoenix, AZ. They followed the same pattern as the Scottsdale location
                    but hired all the employees at one time (7 employees’ total, similar to the Scottsdale location). Their
                    latest endeavor, June 2016 was the purchase of 2 existing stores that are out of state. One of the stores
                    specializes in high-end appliances and bathrooms located in Las Vegas, NV – Elite Home Renovations;
                    and the other site is a typical home supply store located in Albuquerque, NM– IRB Home Supply.
